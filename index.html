        <h2>The Biography</h2>
        <p>I lived in the USA in New York state for the first 10 years of my life- I will tell you some things about my
            time there.
        </p>
        <p>Americans are known to be very patriotic, and I was much the same. Elementary school taught me to be proud of
            my country and my freedom (never mind what any of that actually means). Americans are also known to be very
            self-absorbed, so elementary school forgot to teach me that there were other countries and that some were
            also free.</p>
        <p>American schools teach an odd version of American history, or at least the elementary schools. There's a
            Christopher Columbus and settlers, but no mention of conflict with native Americans, or "Indians" as they
            were called there at that time. Since I never went beyond elementary school before moving to Canada, I don't
            know if they ever teach the unmodified version to older kids.</p>
        <p>Americans are big on sports, but I was not. The part where you kick or throw a ball into a goal was fine
            enough, but the kids playing had a tendency to get rough with it. I don't like hurting people and I don't
            like getting hurt by people, especially not over a point in a game, so no sports for me.</p>
